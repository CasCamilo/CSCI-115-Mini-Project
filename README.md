# CSCI-115-Mini-Project

Main page displays 10 albums by Daft Punk,
and clicking on the name of an album takes you to that album's page.

Album pages contain the list of tracks within the album, their length, 
some facts about the album, and links to each song + the full album.

In the navbar, "About" takes you to the about page which contains information about Daft Punk, and the two individuals who make up Daft Punk.
"Official Site" takes you to Daft Punk's official website, and "Main" of course takes you back to the main page.
